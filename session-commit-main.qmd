## Not recommended, but sometimes useful

The `pr_*` functions all relate to Pull Requests but it is possible to commit to main directly

Commit work using

```{r}
gert::git_commit_all("This is a message")

# or

gert::git_add("file.qmd")
gert::git_commit("This is a message")

```

and then use the `Push` button in the Git RStudio pane or in the Terminal ($)

```{bash}
git push
```

## Accidentally committed 

::: {.incremental}
- If you commit by accident to any branch, but particularly main, you can undo the last commit
- You can undo any number of last commits!
- This has to be done in the Terminal ($)
:::

To undo the commit but keep the changes

```{bash}
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

To remove the commit and changes

```{bash}
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```


## End session
